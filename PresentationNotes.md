#Brewery-finder

##ElevatorPitch
a one minute description of your application
There are so many people who can't make up their mind when going out or staying in....analysis paralysis is real.
We have the solution for those thae

##Concept
What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?
As someone who sometimes likes to go out and sometimes likes to stay in, I would like to find cool breweries in my city, so I can find a new favorite spot OR if I decide to stay in, I want ideas for what to drink at home.

##Process
What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?
Client Side APIs:
Beer Mapping
CocktailsDB

CSS Framework:
Bulma

Third-party API:
Maps JavaScript API

We had two team of two: one for the front end and one for the backend.
Successes:
*using the data from the response of one API call to set the parameters of a second API call
*using geolocation and mapping a route to a lat and lng of a brewery sent to local storage
*getting directions to populate
*randomizing cocktails
